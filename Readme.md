# EKS-Terraform
This is a simple project to generate the whole insfrastructure to support an EKS cluster using terraform including a custom VPC and subnets.
The idea of this project is to serve as consultancy repo for future projects.
It was intended to work with all available providers, but now is only configured to work with the AWS.
